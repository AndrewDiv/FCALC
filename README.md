This repository contains tools for a "**Lazy FCA**" big homework assignment for the course "Ordered Sets in Data Analysis" taught at HSE in the "Data Science" master's program in Fall 2023.

## Lazy FCA

**Checkpoints:**
1. Choose data for your hometask (3 different datasets).\
Useful resources:
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
* [UCI repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets)
2. Binarize the data in different ways and try to perform classification using different parameters for the decision function.
3. Perform classification using pattern structures and various parameters for decision function.
4. Try to find and implement a decision function that outperforms the standard one on your data.
5. Compare your results with classic ML approaches.
6. Submit a report.
